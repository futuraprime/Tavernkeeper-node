A game about taverns!

To get started, first install nodemon globally:

    npm install -g nodemon

Then install the dependencies here by cd-ing into the directory and running

    npm install

Start the server by running
    
    nodemon server.coffee

and then switch on reloading awesomeness with

    grunt

You'll find the server at `http://localhost:13338/`. It'll reload automatically every time the code changes.
